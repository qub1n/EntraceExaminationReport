# EntraceExaminationReport
ComAp Test

Data processing application

Develop console application, which loads data from the entrance examination report writen in text file (see attached examination.txt),
 processes data and saves results in a suitable XML/JSON form to a file.

The correct input (rating) is an integer ranging from 0 to 100.
For each student, the application must count average using the following weights: Math 40%, Physics 35%, English 25%.
For each subject, the application must count simple average, median and modus for all data records and also separately for each group.
Resolve corrupted records and write report about them into XML/JSON file.

Results must be writen into XML or JSON (command line option – XML is default) file. Develop your own suitable XML/JSON structure.
Code must be writen in C# (Microsoft C# Coding Conventions) and compilable under .Net 4 or newer.

Deliver the whole developed project in git repository (git archive --format zip --output /full/path/to/zipfile.zip master) or packed zip file (git is preferred option).
